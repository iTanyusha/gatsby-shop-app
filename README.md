 build a website using a static website generator of your choice for a product catalog

The idea is that we have a list of products (name, price, description, image, etc) that we want to show.

The website should present them in a nice way (both desktop and mobile should be supported) and allow the user to browse through it. 

The website should allow an admin to update (and deploy) new content easily, such as adding new products, changing the orders of products, etc.

An important feature should be the ability to publish a new product at a specific date (new iPhone starts selling on date X, for example) without needing to publish manually
